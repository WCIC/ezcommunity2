<p>
eZ publish is a content management system, among a lot of other things.
 This installation manual will try to cover the job of installing eZ publish
 on your server.
</p>
<p>
This manual covers installation on a Red Hat Linux system; most of what
 is described here can also be applied to other installations, especially
 if your system uses RPM for installation.
 For other systems you would need to do a lot of compiling yourself to make
 this work, or apply the system's own package manager.
</p>
<p>
Finding packages can be done dirctly from vendor sites, though you might
 not be guaranteed that you'll find the package you need.
 In such instances you need to download the source directly from the software
 developer.
</p>
<p>
Different distribution sites for different Unix systems are:

AIX http://www-frec.bull.com/docs/download.htm

Debian http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist

IRIX http://freeware.sgi.com/

HP-UX http://hpux.connect.org.uk/

<a name="Needed Privileges"></a><a name="2.1"></a><h1>2.1 Needed Privileges</h1></p>
<p>
For the standard installation (and for the moment the only method) of eZ
 publish you will need to have the following privileges on your system:

Access to Apache's httpd.conf

</p>
<p>
You will have to install the gcc compiler on your system, see chapter 


 for a list of sites providing software for different Unixes.
Access to compiler

</p>
<p>
You must run certain scripts during installation.
 Some of them are just creating links to different directories; you might
 therefore just create those links via FTP.
Access to a shell

</p>
<p>
Only needed if you want to use the eZ news feed module for regular updates
 of headlines imported from other sites.
Access to cron jobs

Access to Apache's modules

Access to a MySQL database

You might also need the privilege to add new libraries to your system.
</p>
<p>
You might also use other web servers than apache, but then you're on your
 own since we haven't tested eZ publish on other configurations.
 If you do try another web server, please keep a log of what you do and
 submit it to us (pkej@ez.no) for inclusion in future versions of this manual.
<a name="Needed Software"></a><a name="2.2"></a><h1>2.2 Needed Software</h1></p>
<p>
You also need to download and install the following packages, if they aren't
 present on your system already:

</p>
<p>
eZ publish requires MySQL for storage of its data.
MySQL (http://www.mysql.com) version 3.23 or later.

</p>
<p>
Needed by eZ article.
 If you wish to use the default article renderer you need libXml2 installed.
 You can create your own renderers if you don't want to use the default.
libXml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/#Downloads) version 2.2.7 or later.

</p>
<p>
Needed by eZ news feeds parsers.
 If you wish to include headlines from external sites (example developer.ez.no
 or slashdot.org) then you need this installed.
 You can create your own parsers if you don't want to use the default.
libQdom (http://www.trolltech.com) is a part of QT, you need version 2.2.3 or
 later.

</p>
<p>
Needed by eZ article, eZ image catalogue, and all modules using images.
 You need only the command line version.
ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/) newest version

</p>
<p>
It is always recommended to run the latest Apache release, though eZ publish
 shouldn't be very picky with the Apache versions.
 We've used eZ publish with Apache 1.3.13, some have reported that Apache
 1.3.9 isn't useful.
Apache (http://httpd.apache.org/) latest 1.3 release.

Any and all modules you need for apache in addition to mod_php.
 (http://modules.apache.org/)

</p>
<p>
eZ publish uses references for objects and foreach loops.
 Only version 4.0.4pl1 and later supports both of these features satisfactorily.
PHP (http://www.php.net/) version 4.0.4pl1 or later, you need the source code
 version.

eZ publish (http://developer.ez.no/) verision 2.0 or later stable releases.
</p>
<p>
The libraries and php will appear pre-compiled for Linux i386 on http://develope
r.ez.no in the future.
 The software is listed in the order of installation.
<a name="Which Software is Already Installed?"></a><a name="2.3"></a><h1>2.3 Which Software is Already Installed?</h1><a name="Systems Using RPM"></a><a name="2.3.1"></a><h1>2.3.1 Systems Using RPM</h1></p>
<p>
RPM is a system for distributing pre-compiled software.
 The packages also contain pre-configured settings and initialisation files,
 leaving almost nothing to the user, except deciding what to install.
</p>
<p>
To check if a package is available on your system you can run the following
 command (RPM based systems 

rpm -qa | grep <name of program/library>

.
 If you need to know where you can find the different files from that package
 you can follow up on the previous command with the following 

rpm -ql <rpm name>

.
 RPM name is one of the returned names from the previous command, example:
 
</p>
<p>

# pkej@vogol:/etc/httpd > rpm -qa | grep libxml
</p>
<p>

libxml-1.8.7-80
</p>
<p>

libxmld-1.8.7-80
</p>
<p>

# pkej@vogol:/etc/httpd > rpm -ql libxml-1.8.7-80
</p>
<p>

/usr/bin/xml-config
</p>
<p>

<p>
You should test for qt, libxml and imagemagik to check if those are installed
 and working.
<a name="IRIX"></a><a name="2.3.2"></a><h1>2.3.2 IRIX</h1></p>
<p>
By accessing the software manager (you must be root) you can get a list
 of installed software, scroll or search that list to find the packages
 you're interested in.
 Double click on the tabs to the left to get information about where specific
 files are installed.
<a name="Other Systems"></a><a name="2.3.3"></a><h1>2.3.3 Other Systems</h1></p>
<p>
On other systems you should read the documentation for that system to learn
 how to find out what software is already installed.
</p>
<p>
You could try to use the command 

find

 to find the software.
 It is used thus: 

find .
 -name 
*<program name>
*

 from the /usr/, /local/ , /lib/, /share/ directories.
 In extreme cases you could try from the root of the system, but this will
 take a long time and will also hog resources on your computer.
 Therefore we urge you to learn how to use the proper installation features
 of your system to find the software already installed.
<a name="Installation of Required Software"></a><a name="2.4"></a><h1>2.4 Installation of Required Software</h1></p>
<p>
If you've found pre-compiled versions of all the software packaged for use
 with an installation tool, you just have to install that software using
 the tool.
 Instructioins for its usage is often found using the command 

man <installation tool name>

 or by reading your system's documentation or the supplier's website.
</p>
<p>
If you've had to download source code you will find instructions on how
 to compile and install the software you've downloaded at the software developer
's website.
 This requires a bit of knowledge and you should only undertake this if
 you feel confident about the job.
</p>
<p>
This manual will only cover configuration of the software needed and compilation
 of PHP to use the other software.
<a name="Important Notice"></a><a name="2.4.1"></a><h1>2.4.1 Important Notice</h1></p>
<p>
You should read all the README, INSTALL and similar files found with the
 software packages you download.
 They often contain tips on how to configure, compile and install the software
 on your system.
 It will save you a lot of time and aggravation if you follow instructions
 supplied with the software.
</p>
<p>
If problems arise during installation of the software, please turn to the
 suppliers support forums, mailing list archives and FAQs, your questions
 will often be answered there.
 If the supplier's forums doesn't seem to help you, you should check the
 support forums at our site.
</p>
<p>
You should always do a search of the forums before posting any questions.
<a name="Compile Configuration"></a><a name="3"></a><h1>3 Compile Configuration</h1><a name="PHP"></a><a name="3.1"></a><h1>3.1 PHP</h1><a name="Unpacking"></a><a name="3.1.1"></a><h1>3.1.1 Unpacking</h1></p>
<p>
After you have downloaded PHP you need to unpack it somewhere where you
 can compile and configure the software.
 To unpack run the command:


# tar zxvf php-4.0.x.tar.gz
</p>
<p>
Where the x is the version of php you've downloaded.
 Then you need to move into the directory you extracted php into:


# cd php-4.0.x
<a name="Configuration"></a><a name="3.1.2"></a><h1>3.1.2 Configuration</h1></p>
<p>
You'll need either an apache module or a command line version of PHP to
 use eZ publish on your website.
 We recommend you use PHP as an apache module.
 You will also need the command line version if you want to use the cron
 jobs for periodical updates of the eZ news feed module.
</p>
<p>
Thus for our recommended installation of PHP you need both the command line
 and module versions of PHP.
<a name="Common"></a><a name="3.1.2.1"></a><h1>Common</h1></p>
<p>
Both the command line and apache module versions need to have the following
 configurations added to the configuration tool:

--enable-trans-sid This lets PHP use session id's which don't rely on cookies.
 It does not disable normal cookie based sessions.
(
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.enable-trans-sid
)

--with-mysql This tells PHP that the mysql functionality should be used.
(
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.with-mysql
)

--enable-magic-quotes This tells PHP to enable magic quotes by default.
 you can also turn this feature on and off on a directory by directory basis
 in either the 

.htaccess

 files (if you use them) or in the setup of the virtual server in 

httpd.conf

.
(
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.enable-magic-quot
es
)

--with-dom This configures PHP to include libxml.
 

(http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.with-dom)

--with-qtdom This configures PHP to include libqdom.
 It isn't up on the PHP site with a link, but it works as --with-dom.
</p>
<p>
You should also go through the web page: 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php
 and make sure that there isn't other functionality you would like to have
 included.
<a name="Command Line"></a><a name="3.1.2.2"></a><h1>Command Line</h1></p>
<p>
The default is to create a command line version of PHP.
 Therefore you don't need to add more configuration options for this.
<a name="Apache Module"></a><a name="3.1.2.3"></a><h1>Apache Module</h1></p>
<p>
To build an apache module you need to add:

--with-apxs This compiles PHP as an apache module.

 
(http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.with-apxs)
<a name="Other Web Servers"></a><a name="3.1.2.4"></a><h1>Other Web Servers</h1></p>
<p>
We haven't tested our software with other web servers than apache.
 If you need to try out other web servers, read this document 
http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.configure.php#install.configure.servers
 to learn how you configure for the web server you will be using.
<a name="Creating the Configuration"></a><a name="3.1.2.5"></a><h1>Creating the Configuration</h1></p>
<p>
Now you just have to run the 

./configure

 program with the apropriate configuration directives which we discussed
 in the preceeding sections, for an apache module you'd do the following:


# ./configure --enable-trans-sid --with-mysql --with-magic-quotes --with-apxs
 --with-dom --with-qtdom
</p>
<p>
Remember that to compile a script/cgi version you'd need to change that
 line to:


# ./configure --enable-trans-sid --with-mysql --with-magic-quotes --with-dom
 --with-qtdom
<a name="Compilation"></a><a name="3.1.3"></a><h1>3.1.3 Compilation</h1></p>
<p>
To compile you need to run the command 

make

:


make
<a name="Installation"></a><a name="3.1.4"></a><h1>3.1.4 Installation</h1></p>
<p>
To install your new PHP package you need to run the following command:


make install
<a name="Apache Configuration"></a><a name="4"></a><h1>4 Apache Configuration</h1></p>
<p>
For the moment we have only one solution for configuring apache.
 There are other methods, and we'll document them in the future.
<a name="Dual Virtual Host"></a><a name="4.1"></a><h1>4.1 Dual Virtual Host</h1></p>
<p>
This set up is based on having two different virtual hosts for your administrati
on back-end and the main site.
 The main site would typically be known as 

www.yoursite.com

 and the administration would be 

admin.yoursite.com

; the names are up to you, theoretically you could have different names,
 for example 

mysite.yoursite.com

 and 

administration.mysite.com

.
</p>
<p>
The virtual host is configured through the 

httpd.conf

 file which is the main configuration of Apache.
 Following is an example of such a host, remember to exchange everything
 within brackets (

[

 and 

]

) with your preferred and local settings and also remove the brackets.
</p>
<p>

# User site 
</p>
<p>

<VirtualHost yourdomain.org> 
</p>
<p>

<Directory [/your/apache/documentroot/]> 
</p>
<p>

Options FollowSymLinks Indexes ExecCGI 
</p>
<p>

AllowOverride None 
</p>
<p>

</Directory>
</p>
<p>

RewriteEngine On
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This line and the next should be written on the same line in your apache.conf
 file.

RewriteRule ^/filemanager/filedownload/([^/]+)/(.*)$ 
[/your/apache/documentroot]/publish_dist/ezfilemanager/files/$1 [T="application/
oct-stream",S=1]
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</VirtualHost>
</p>
<p>

# Admin site 
</p>
<p>

<VirtualHost admin.yourdomain.org> 
</p>
<p>

<Directory [/your/apache/documentroot]/admin> 
</p>
<p>

Options FollowSymLinks Indexes ExecCGI 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

ServerName [admin.yourdomain.org]
</p>
<p>

ServerAlias [admin.yourdomain.org]
</p>
<p>

</VirtualHost>
</p>
<p>
The format of the 

httpd.conf

 file is covered at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/ for a complete understanding
 of the above information you'll need to read that documentation.
 You should note that you can't use any rewrite ruels inside the <directory>
 part within the <VirtualHost>.
</p>
<p>
If you didn't compile PHP with magic quotes; or other software relies on
 PHP not using magic quotes you can add the following line into each virtual
 host section:


php_value magic_quotes_gpc 1
<a name="eZ publish Installation"></a><a name="5"></a><h1>5 eZ publish Installation</h1><a name="Database"></a><a name="5.1"></a><h1>5.1 Database</h1></p>
<p>
Now you need to create a database in MySQL, the default name we use is publish,
 but you can change that to whatever pleases you.


# mysqladmin create publish
</p>
<p>
Add a publish user in MySQL.
 To add a user you can use the MySQL client to log on to mysql and then
 create the user:


# mysql>grant all on publish.* to publish@localhost identified by "secret";
</p>
<p>
where secret is your password.
 Then you need to add the default eZ publish data into your newly created
 database: 


# mysql -uroot -p publish < sql/publish.sql
<a name="Program Files"></a><a name="5.2"></a><h1>5.2 Program Files</h1></p>
<p>
The next step is to install the eZ publish package in your document root
 directory.
 First you need to unpack the software in a temporary directory:


# cd /tmp


# tar zxvf /path/to/ezpublish-2.0.tar.gz
</p>
<p>
The next step is to move the files to your document root:


# mv /tmp/publish_dist /your/apache/documentroot
</p>
<p>
When all this is done you need to tell eZ publish a little about the site
 you're running.
 You'll need to edit the 

site.ini

 file which you will find in the document root:


# cd /your/apache/documentroot


# vi site.ini
</p>
<p>
Instead of vi you can use your preferred text editor.
 You'll need to add information about the username, hostname and password
 of your database.
 More information on what you can do with 

site.ini

 can be found in the 

eZ publish Customisation Guide

.
</p>
<p>
The next important step is to run the script modfix.
 This script will create symbolic links needed and set permissions.


# ./modfix.sh
<a name="Now What?"></a><a name="6"></a><h1>6 Now What?</h1></p>
<p>
After installing eZ publish you can test your site through the URL http://www.you
rsite.com/ and you can administrate your site from the URL http://admin.yoursite.co
m/, of course, if you did anything different the names of the admin and
 the public site might be different.
</p>
<p>

NOTE: 
The default user name and password for your site will be admin/publish.
 Remember to change the password.
</p>
<p>
The next manual you should read is the 

eZ publish Customisation Guide

, it tells you how to configure the software to use the functionality you
 want, as well as how you change the templates to suit your needs.
</p>
<p>
When you're finished with the design and the initial testing you can head
 over to http://zez.org/ for articles about community building as well as
 programming, or you can visit http://developer.ez.no for updates, articles
 about eZ publish and how to work with it, as well as keeping abreast of
 new developments.
