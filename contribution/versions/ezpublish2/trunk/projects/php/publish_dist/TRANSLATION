eZ trade / eZ publish translation guide
---------------------------------------

This is an attempt to make a comprehensive explanation of how eZ publish
translation should be handled. Any questions, suggestions or corrections should
be directed to translators@lists.ez.no, or to the translation coordinator,
Gunnstein Lye <gl@ez.no>.

This information can also be found at
http://developer.ez.no/article/static/73

You don't need to read this if you use eZ linguist for translation, but the
information is provided for those who are interested. We recommend that you use
eZ linguist if you can. (There is one exception for this rule: The article edit
help document, article_articleedit.hlp, can not be translated with eZ linguist.
At the moment, this must be done manually. You will find this file under
ezarticle/admin/help/.)

BACKGROUND

Download eZ publish and or eZ trade. you will find a directory structure like:

         ezarticle
         ezimagecagalogue
         ezforum
         etc ...

Each module has two sub directories user and admin with intl catalogues under 
them. It's in the intl catalogue which the text used on the pages are defined. 
So you'll have a structure like this:

publish_directory
\ ezarticle
  | user
  | \ intl
  |   | en_GB
  |   \ no_NO
  \ admin
    \ intl
      | en_GB
      \ no_NO

The directories under the 'intl' directories contain the actual translations.
The naming of the languages is based on the locale conventions. British
English is en_GB, American English is en_US, German is de_DE, Norwegian
(bokmaal) is no_NO. You get the picture. Before you begin your translation,
you need to find the locale name of your language. If in doubt, contact us.
You'll find more information about the locale conventions here:
ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1766.txt and here:
ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2277.txt

The primary language of eZ publish is en_GB (British English). You should copy
from en_GB when you create a new translation. You can safely assume that the
keys in the en_GB translation are correct. If you find they are not, please
submit a bug report:
http://developer.ez.no/bug/report/

All static strings in eZ publish are stored in separate translation files
called *.php.ini. They consist of a header and key=value pairs, like this:
[strings]
head_line=Latest news
category=Category
search=Search
top_level=Top level
description=Description
next=Next
prev=Previous

So, in short, what you need to do is to translate these values. But read on,
there are a few more details.


LOCALE

In classes/locale in your eZ publish distribution are a set of *.ini files,
one for each translated language. These locale files contain general settings
for things like time and date display, currency and day/month names. Here is
an extract from en_GB.ini:
[RegionalSettings]
LanguageISO=iso-8859-1
CurrencySymbol=$
DecimalSymbol=.
ThousandsSymbol=,
FractDigits=2
PositivePrefixCurrencySymbol=yes
NegativePrefixCurrencySymbol=yes
TimeFormat=%H:%i:%s
ShortTimeFormat=%H:%i
DateFormat=%E, %F %d, %Y
ShortDateFormat=%d.%m.%Y
MondayFirst=yes
jan=Jan
feb=Feb

The LanguageISO setting decides which charset to use when rendering text.
MondayFirst decides whether the week starts on Monday or Sunday. The date and
time formats contain characters prefixed with % (percentage symbol). The
following characters are currently supported (more may be implemented later):
%d - day of the month, 2 digits with leading zeros; i.e. "01" to "31"
%D - day of the week, textual, 3 letters; i.e. "Fri"
%E - day of the week, textual, long; i.e. "Friday"
%F - month, textual, long; i.e. "January"
%H - hour, 24-hour format; i.e. "00" to "23"
%i - minutes; i.e. "00" to "59"
%m - month; i.e. "01" to "12"
%M - month, textual, 3 letters; i.e. "Jan"
%s - seconds; i.e. "00" to "59"
%Y - year, 4 digits; i.e. "1999"
