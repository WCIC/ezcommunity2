How to write your own eZ publish module:
---------------------------------------

It's very simple....

You create a new folder in the root e.g.

ezexample

The first two letters must be ez

In the ezexample folder you need the following sub foledrs:

ezexample/classes  : here you put your class files
ezexample/admin    : here you put the admin files
ezexample/user     : here you put the user files

The datasupplier

In both admin/ and user/ you need a file datasupplier.php. This file
is responsible for serving your page requests.

A minimal datasupplier could look like this:

<php>
switch ( $url_array[2] )
{
    case "mypage":
    {

    }
    break;

    default :
    {
        // go to default module page or show an error message
        print( "Error: your page request was not found" );
    }
}
</php>

You need to alter the modfix.sh script to create a link for your admin 
pages.

You find a section which defines the modules which are implemented.
There you add your own module like this:

<pre> 
files="
...
...
ezexample
"
</pre>

Then you have to add the cache dir:

dirs="
...
...
ezexample/admin/cache
"

Then of course you have to run the modfix.sh script which will create the
links needed.

You need to create a icon for your module. This must be a 32x32 gif
with the name module_icon.gif and it should be placed in the folder
ezexample/admin/images/module_icon.gif .

Site.ini

You have to add a block in the site ini which defines the template 
folders and language settings.

<pre>
[eZExampleMain]
AdminTemplateDir=templates/standard/
TemplateDir=templates/standard/
Language=en_GB
Preference=value
</pre>

Then you have to create the menubox.php which is placed in 
 ezexample/admin/menubox.php . A minimal menubox is shown below.

<php>
$menuItems = array(
    array( "/example/page/", "{intl-example_page}" )
    );
</php>


Lanuguage files:

You have to create a language file for the menubox.php file. This 
should be placed in ezexample/admin/intl/en_GB/menubox.php.ini and
could contain something like this:

<pre>
[strings]
module_name=example
</pre>




And finally when you're done. You can send your code to the developers
of eZ publish so they can add you module as an extension to eZ publish.
Code can be sendt to <mail bf@ez.no eZ publish contribution, bf@ez.no>
