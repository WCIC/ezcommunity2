eZ trade / eZ publish translation guide
---------------------------------------

This file will give you a brief introduction on how to translate eZ publish and 
eZ trade to your language.

Download eZ publish and or eZ trade. you will find a directory structure like:

         ezarticle
         ezimagecagalogue
         ezforum
         etc ...

Each module has two sub directories user and admin with intl catalogues under 
them. It's in the intl catalogue which the text used on the pages are defined. 
So you'll have a structure like this:

                          /intl/no_NO
                         /intl/en_GB/
                   /user/
          ezarticle\admin\intl\en_GB
                               \no_NO


What you need to do is to create a new sub directory in every intl catalogue 
and call them fr_FR or what the ISO code for your language is. And make a copy 
of the files in the en_GB directory in the same catalogue.

Then you get several .ini files with contents like this:
[strings]
head_line=Login
username=User name
password=Password
error_login=Could not login, check login and password.
ok=OK       

Then you just replace words on the right of the = with the equivalent word(s)
in your language.
