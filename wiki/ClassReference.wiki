== Class Reference ==

We have just updated and published the eZ Community 2 Class Reference. 

The [http://ezcommunity.net/docs class reference] is a cross indexed documentation package generated from the eZ Community source tree.

You can now find the eZ Community 2 class reference documentation here at http://ezcommunity.net/docs. 

Click [http://ezcommunity.net/docs/view/index here] to get the class reference list. If you want to see the classes sorted by module you will find that [http://ezcommunity.net/docs/view/structure here]. 

If you're looking for documentation on a particluar class, e.g. the eZLog class, you will find that by typing [http://ezcommunity.net/docs/view/ezlog /docs/view/ezlog]. 

The information are aimed at programmers and integrators. This is very handy if you're in active development in the eZ publish project. 

Any suggestions for improvements are welcome.
