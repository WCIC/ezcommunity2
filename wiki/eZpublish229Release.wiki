eZ publish 2.2.9 release

Author: eZCommunity.net :: Administrator

This is believed and expected to be the last release of the eZ publish 2.2 Series.

eZ Systems has hinted since the gradually smaller change sets between the last 4 releases that new functionality was not going to happen, choosing to release only bug fixes which improved stability and reliability.

For those hoping for the eventual release of the heavily hinted eZ publish 2.2.10 (perhaps on the 1 year anniversary of the release of 2.2.9). I say don't hold your breath, If you have a bug, the fix you create will be faster than theirs. Go self sufficiency!
